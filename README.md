# audio2ascii
Convert an audio file to an ascii file read by Natron/Nuke (based on sox)

You must add sox: sudo apt-get install sox (on Debian based system)
and to support more audio formats than 'wav': sudo apt-get install libsox-fmt-all

If you want a gui:
you must add yad: sudo apt-get install yad (on Debian based system)
and launch it  with '-g' parameter
